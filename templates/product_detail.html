                                        <p>Polyester is deemed lower quality due to its none natural quality’s. Made
                                            from synthetic materials, not natural like wool. Polyester suits become
                                            creased easily and are known for not being breathable. Polyester suits
                                            tend to have a shine to them compared to wool and cotton suits, this can
                                            make the suit look cheap. The texture of velvet is luxurious and
                                            breathable. Velvet is a great choice for dinner party jacket and can be
                                        worn all year round.</p>
